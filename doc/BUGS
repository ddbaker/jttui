If you email me bug-report, I will update this file on the main
web site (see README). Don't hesitate to report bugs, it may be useful for
others. At this time I accept multiple same bug reports, to decide what
is bigger problem for users and fix it first (this may change in future
to avoid overload of my mailbox).

See REPORTING-BUGS file to know what information is required for a bug report.

This file documents known bugs and their status.
Possible status: 
  undecided  -  status is not yet assigned
  fixed      -  bug is fixed in this version
  willfix    -  bug is planned to be fixed
  wontfix    -  bug will not be fixed
  cantfix    -  bug cannot be fixed i.e. it's not my fault (blame others)
  nonbug     -  it's not bug, it's a feature ;-)


Bug 1: Mouse does not work on console when run from the midnight commander.
cantfix: any application run in that way including mc itself have this problem
         because mc will run it in pty instead of tty if it is run with
         sub-shell support (use `mc -u` to run it without).

Bug 2: On some terminals block of characters are not erased when they should,
       but on others it is OK.
       Characters appear at bad locations, but C-l redraw them OK.
       example-jttui-2-keynames.rb does this when array of names is reseted.
cantfix: you have bad terminfo (or possibly termcap) database of terminals
         or you have bad TERM environment variable, this is very common.
         The most of terminals like gnome-terminal, rxvt, aterm, ...
         have TERM=xterm which works in normal situations, but they don't
         interpret all xterm control sequences correctly.
         For gnome-terminal set TERM to gnome
         For others, try to set TERM to xterm-color

Bug 3: Error message "Error opening terminal: something." at startup.
cantfix: This is error message from curses library. It appears when you have
         TERM variable set to terminal which is not in terminfo or termcap
         database. Update your terminal database or set TERM variable to
         something more suitable.

Bug 4: Dependency on external program `tty`.
willfix: Ruby doesn't have ttyname system call implemented as of 1.6.4.
         Maybe I will place it to jtcur.c (however, this will make jtkey.rb
         dependent on jtcur.c which might not be good.

Bug 5: When used in configuration with gpm mouse and more threads are running
       and some of them use IO objects, then keyboard input might be blocked
       (and after clicking with mouse, some parts of keys will be read).
cantfix: This is bug in ruby's select. I have written a patch against 1.6.5.
	 Now recent ruby versions should contain more complete patch developed
	 with matz. Following patch works, but I consider it now
	 as _DEPRECATED_.
