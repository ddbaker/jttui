This file describes successful use of JTTui on different platforms.
I would like more entries from you.


kernel+version	distro + version	version of ruby		status
Linux 2.4.18	Debian woody		1.6.6			OK
Linux 2.4.8	Mandrake 8.1		1.6.4			OK
Linux 2.4.3	Mandrake 8.0		1.6.2			OK
Linux 2.2.17	Mandrake 7.2		1.6.1			BAD(1)
SunOS 5.8				1.6.5			OK(2)
SunOS 5.7				1.6.5			OK(3)
win32		Windows			unknown			OK(4)

Genral note: ruby versions before 1.6.6 contains bug that causes deadlock
in some multithreaded applications using JTTui. Newer versions are recommended.


(1) this ruby version segfaults occasionally when moving windows of
example-jtui-1.rb out of screen and back

(2) output of uname -a on this system is:
SunOS sunray2 5.8 Generic_108528-10 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Blade-1000

(2) output of uname -a on this system is:
SunOS sol21 5.7 Generic_106541-17 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1

(4) cygwin compiler,
few changes to jtcur.c were required, it should not be required
starting with 0.10.3 but I cannot confirm this.
