	to wrap, but it can be disabled by label.autowrap=false

2002-04-14  Jakub Travnik

	* examples/addlocalpath.rb added, it contains code that modifies
	library search path to include relative directories in JTTui source
	tree.
	* examples/example*.rb modified to require 'addlocalpath'
	* doc/PLATFORMS updated

2002-04-07  Jakub Travnik

	user programs have to require 'jttui/jtsomething' except for jtcur
	* doc/THANKS file added
	* documentation spell-checked
	* doc/starting-guide.txt added information about requiring jttui

2002-02-15  Jakub Travnik

	* jtgpm.rb gpm mouse now works even when consoles does not contain
	'tty' substring in name (such as '/dev/vc/1'). Original libgpm
	library (which we bypass and comunicate with gpm server directly)
	itself have problem with this (you can try for example with
	Midnight Commander aka mc). Still guess is needed to find out if
	program should activate gpm or use xterm mouse in jtkey.rb

	call is implemented in jtcur.c now

	* version 0.10.2
	* jttuistd.rb JTTDialog#settab now throws InvalidTabWindow instead
	of RuntimeError

	JTTWLabel keys work again (as they were in pre 0.10.0)
	* patch for ruby select in doc/BUGS is deprecated, it was simple
	but more complete patch was developed with matz

2001-11-25  Jakub Travnik

	* jttuistd.rb JTTWTree node can be selected using select_node method
	* jttui.rb catch of :quitrootloop in JTTui.run moved to include
