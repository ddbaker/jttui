Here are the thinks to be done or wishes for next versions.
Warning: some are to naive or undecided yet. Write me an email
to let me know which you find most useful.

* Rework alignment to be more usable
  (target is something like Delphi/Kylix have)

* Add more widgets:
  *  Editbox - like editline over multiple lines
  *  Textview - area for viewing any text (file or whatever in memory)
  *  SimpleHTML - simple html viewer (colors, bold, paragraph alignment, links)
  *  Dropdownbox - like JTTWListLabels but not obstructing the big area
                   except for actual selecting
  *  ? - send me ideas of what might be useful for you
