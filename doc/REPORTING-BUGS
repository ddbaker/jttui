This file will instruct you how to report bugs.

note: bash shell is assumed, modify command to your shell if needed.

PLEASE READ doc/BUGS before submitting your report.

Information to include:
(see example at end)

1, Version of your system:
 $ uname -a

2, Version of ruby:
 $ ruby --version

3, Curses version - this is harder, if you have rpm system run
 $ rpm -q ncurses
or
 $ rpm -q curses
otherwise try your own method that apply to your system.

4, JTTui version. It is in file doc/VERSION

5, If program causing error was included example, write its name only.
   If it was your code, send it to me, at least bug-relevant part.

6, Describe what you have been doing when it happened.

7, Write why do you think it is bug. (not all bugs are obvious to everyone)

8, If error is reported by ruby interpreter copy&paste it or redirect
   error output to file and include it:
  $ ruby ./someexample.rb 2>my_error_message

Send it to J.Travnik@sh.cvut.cz WITH SUBJECT CONTAINING WORD 'JTTUI',
otherwise I or my SPAM filter (currently I don't have it but due to increasing
amount of SPAM I get I plan to install it) may throw it away.
You have been warned.
